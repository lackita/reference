- Really Advance Something Very Important
- Visions not goals
- Fund people not projects
- Only fund the very best people
- It's a Research Community, not a research project
- Fund Problem Finding - not just Problem Solving
- Milestones not deadlines
- It's "Baseball" not "Golf"
- You can't think inside the Beltway!
- It's about shaping "computer stuff" to human ends per the vision
- "if you can make your own tools, HW and SW, then you must!"
- Software drives the hardware, rather than vice versa
- "Living Lab" - make enough of the inventions so that more than the inventors can use them
- Argue for clarity, not to win
- An important part of the research results are new and better researchers
- The reaching is the reward
- Better and perfect are the two enemies of WHAT IS ACTUALLY NEEDED!
- You miss 100% of the shots you don't take! A good hockey player goes to where the puck is; a great one goes to where the puck will be!
- Go out to the future and bring the future back
